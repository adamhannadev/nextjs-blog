> My goal is to become a paid junior web developer by the end of 2023.

I am Adam. A 35 year old professional ballroom dance instructor from Victoria BC. I've been teaching dance
for 15 years and running my own dance school for the last 10. I love my job, but running a dance school and
competing locally and internationally with my students takes a toll on the body and mind.

I have been a hobbyist developer for even longer than I have been dancing. Ever since I learned I could create
web pages with html and css, I have enjoyed the power and creativity to create things using code.

Over the years I have taken various courses online and watched countless hours of video tutorials. Along with
many many articles and blog posts advising me as to which is the best programming language to learn in 20**.

I was never really well inspired by the projects they were making through these beginner tutorials, but I found
that trying to make a fully fledged full stack application on my own was an incredibly difficult challenge for my skills
and my willpower. Then I discovered [Rails](rubyonrails.org).

I fell in love with the elegance of writing Ruby code and I loved that rails provided an opinionated framework for me to 
learn best practices from. The cli generators and the ActiveRecord ORM made things a lot more accessible and I felt like I could
handle doing it all myself.

So over the years I created a couple of CRM style apps for my dance studio. They helped me keep track of students and their lessons,
their progress and their choreography. However, without adequate time to polish them and learn to integrate them with the systems I am
working with, they both fell out of use after a time.

This brings me to now. Although I enjoy my job as a dance teacher, I do miss working at a place where I am not the one in charge. I would
love to be able to spend my days collaborating with others to create new features, write tests and optimize code where I can be mentored in
this world where I have spent so much time on my own.

I have laid out my goal. My goal is to become a paid junior web developer by the end of 2023. I know that for this I will have to be accountable
to myself, so I have decided to keep track of my progress with this blog. I will post to keep track of my learning journey, my frustrations and my
celebrations. Here I go.
