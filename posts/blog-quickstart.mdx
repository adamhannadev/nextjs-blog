In order to prove my skills as a web developer I am going to need to have projects that are hosted online and
easily viewed by potential employers. This blog was a great opportunity to get started and have something instantly
available. 

I wanted to host a static generated site so that I could focus on content creation rather than infastrucure.
Since I am comfortable with Javascript and I want to learn more about React, I chose to go with the Next.js Blog template.
It was pretty easy to get started and it hosts quickly and deploys seamlessly to (Netlify) [www.netlify.com].

I like that all of the posts are saved individually and the site loads really quickly. I think this will also be a great opportunity
to learn more about (markdown) [https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/], because it is used to write the posts.
